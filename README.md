# STA410-CP

This Project aim to present trade offs in runtime and accuracy in both integration methods for high-dimensional problems, and how advanced sampling techniques can be applied to the real-world. 

By building a part of this poject around seismic data, I aim to gain further insights into how we can apply these methods, and evaluate which methods may be better in general or suited for the situation.
